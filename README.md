# Joshua Project Python Library
> This is a Python library to help one use APIv2 to fetch the data from the database JoshuaProject.net web site.


![](logo-800x300.png)

This library uses [Joshua Project's APIv2](https://joshuaproject.net/api/v2).
You'll need an **`api_key`** to use API and the library.
For details, see [**Documentation**](https://joshuaproject.net/api/v2/documentation).

## Install

`pip install joshuaproject`

## How to use

### URL Constricting finctions

#### 1. Get your API key

From [here](https://joshuaproject.net/api/v2) and set it in a variable or pass to functions:

```python
api_key='your_api_key'
```

#### 2. Get all people groups in a specific country. 

Countries are currently encoded as two-letter codes according to *US Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)*, which is absolete a bit differs from the international **ISO 3166** standard. See [details](https://www.geodatasource.com/resources/tutorials/international-country-code-fips-versus-iso-3166/).

The library provides a helper function to work around the current ambiguity.

Build an URL to query all people groups in India:

```python
url_pgs_cntry('IN',api_key=api_key)
```




    'https://joshuaproject.net/api/v2/people_groups?ROG3=IN&api_key=your_api_key'



## Development
